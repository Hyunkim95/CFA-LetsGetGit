# About the Project
As students, we notice that it is hard to accommodate both students who are excelling and struggling in class.
This issue arises due to the expanding gap between students, limited manpower resources and the challenging task to pinpoint the core underlying reasons for the obstacles.

Therefore, this project aims to provide a linking bridge between the teacher, struggling students and the excelling students through various approaches.

The first approach is to ignite rivalry between students so that struggling students would be compelled to do more work to catch up with the excelling students.

The second approach is to emulate the teachers' mind through the transcription of resources list to tackle the issue of having limited manpower resources. This is so that students would be able to access additional resources outside of classroom materials to supplement the teachings in the classroom while adopting individualised learning pace.  

The third approach is to implement a way for teachers to monitor the progress of the students to understand the rationale behind struggling students.



# The Thinking Process
As a group, we brainstormed some of the problems and the ideas to address the issues relating to the learning paces of students.

We then proceeded to create a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/OgpZiHGR/team-sneezy) to identify the core functions of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and also to identify the possible future functions to be added to our application.
